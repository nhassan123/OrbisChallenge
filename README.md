# OrbisChallenge
Project files for the 2018 Orbis Challenge.
The objective was to build an AI bot that could capture more territory in the game Serpentine. 
We programmed our bot to maximize the area it captures and avoid other snake bodies so that it did not get killed. More instructions on the game and overall set up can be found in the Docs folder in StarterKit.
